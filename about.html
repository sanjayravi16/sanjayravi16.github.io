                        <p>SAS plays BCC was founded by Sreyas Ravi, Alex Steel, and Sanjay Ravi in the summer 
                            of 2014. We play a variety of genres of music, from heavy rock, to pop rock, 
                            classical, and more! We started out as a string trio from South Brunswick High 
                            School, and have been recognized throughout the music program in the township. In 
                            May 2015, we won first place at a competition in East Brunswick and have been 
                            invited to play at many other events. We would like to entertain many others like 
                            we have done in the past several months for any special event. We do many gigs from 
                            small social gatherings to large parties. Our goal is to make sure that your events 
                            make a long lasting affect on those that attend and on you, the host. Thank you for 
                            choosing us as your live entertainment!
